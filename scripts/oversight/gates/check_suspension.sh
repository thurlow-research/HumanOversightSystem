# check_suspension.sh — shared helper for gate suspension checks.
#
# Source this file in any gate script, then call is_suspended() before
# running checks. If suspended, the gate should print a warning and exit 0
# (non-blocking) rather than failing.
#
# The suspension manifest is contract/gate-suspension.md — a human-only file
# that lists which gates/roles are currently suspended. Agents may not create
# or modify this file.
#
# Usage in a gate script:
#   source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/check_suspension.sh"
#   is_suspended "lint" && { print_suspended "lint"; exit 0; }
