"""panel_logic.py — corroboration counting and tier ranking for the review panel.

SPEC-376 / Issue #376. The HOS cross-vendor panel arbiter (run_panel.sh ARBITER
stage) deduplicates the independent reviewers' findings. This module adds the
missing CORROBORATION-RANKING step on top of that dedup pass: it counts how many
INDEPENDENT vendors agreed on each deduplicated finding, classifies findings into
two corroboration tiers, and orders them so cross-vendor-confirmed findings
surface to the human first.

Why this matters (research grounding):
  - CodeRabbit produces ~1.7x single-reviewer volume (Loker 2025); panel volume
    scales with roster size. Without ranking, reviewer fatigue is the failure mode.
  - AgenticSCR's detector->validator architecture raised precision while cutting
    comment volume 81% by surfacing corroborated findings first (Charoenwet 2026).

Authoritative clustering stays with Sonnet (architect binding 2): the arbiter
prompt emits per-finding `merged_from` membership, and THIS module counts vendor
corroboration deterministically from that membership. Same-vendor / different-lens
(codex:security + codex:adversary) collapses to ONE independent source (binding 3).

SPEC-332 / Issue #332 extends this module with the panel's DETERMINISTIC TRIAGE
logic, moved out of run_panel.sh under the #314 policy (Python for logic, shell
for launch): compute_triage_floor (the risk-tier floor from changed-file paths +
added-line count, formerly the `det_floor` bash function) and compute_sqc_sample
(the salted-deterministic red-team audit sample, formerly inline bash SHA256 +
modulo). Both are a BYTE-FOR-BYTE parity refactor (binding 6) — no behavior change.
The shell now calls the `triage-floor` and `sqc-sample` subcommands instead of
re-implementing the rules.

SPEC-333 / Issue #333 extends this module further with three more deterministic
transforms moved out of run_panel.sh under the same #314 policy: extract_json
(best-effort JSON extraction from a raw reviewer/arbiter response, formerly the
`extract_json` bash function), aggregate_findings (the per-reviewer jq merge loop
that tags each finding with reviewer+lens), and the verdict-finalization pair
count_tiers + render_tier_section (the tier-count jq + the `render_tier_findings`
jq filter). All parity refactors (binding 6) — no behavior change, no suppression.
The shell now calls the `extract-json`, `aggregate`, `tier-counts`, and
`render-tier` subcommands instead of re-implementing the logic. Per binding 5 the
aggregate/tier-counts/render-tier subcommands surface STRUCTURAL parse failures
non-zero (exit 2) while still writing a fallback — they do not adopt the default
ranking path's blanket exit-0.

PURITY (binding 6 / AC4): count_corroboration, reconcile_membership,
rank_findings, compute_triage_floor, compute_sqc_sample, extract_json,
aggregate_findings, count_tiers, and render_tier_section perform NO subprocess,
network, or file I/O. They are importable and unit-testable with plain dicts /
synthetic inputs. Only the __main__ CLI shim does I/O.

FAIL-OPEN (binding 7): a finding with no resolvable membership defaults to
corroborated_by=1, corroboration_tier=2. Nothing is ever suppressed (binding 9).

    The Sonnet arbiter stage in run_panel.sh gates what actually reaches the human,

    hardcodes an empty "no issues" verdict even when reviewers found real issues;
    (b) `claude` is present but returns prose/empty (a documented Sonnet failure
    mode, #113) -> extract_json degrades to {"findings": []}. Either way the
    reviewer fan-out's findings (archived in findings.raw.json) are silently
    dropped, no threads post, and the PR is left mergeable.

    This mirrors run_second_review.sh's fail-closed reconciliation: if the arbiter
    yielded ZERO findings while `raw_findings` is non-empty, SALVAGE — return a
    verdict carrying the raw reviewer findings UNGROUPED (no dedup/corroboration;
    that synthesis WAS the arbiter's job and it failed) plus a summary flagging the
    failure and an `arbiter_salvaged: true` marker the caller uses to force
    escalation. The salvaged findings still flow through annotate_and_rank, which
    reconstructs genuine cross-vendor corroboration by file+line proximity — so a
    truly corroborated issue still surfaces as Tier 1 even without the arbiter.
