"""codeowners.py — CODEOWNERS-derived HUMAN_REQUIRED gate (SPEC-303b).

The overseer's protected-surface gate (``require_human_approval.py``) only covers
paths on the explicit protected-surface list. CODEOWNERS-owned paths that are NOT
on that list had no reviewer restriction — any collaborator (including a bot) could
approve them. This module closes that gap (#303 Finding 2): any changed file whose
CODEOWNERS owner is a human (or an ``@org/team`` entry) forces HUMAN_REQUIRED,
regardless of risk tier, additive to the existing protected-surface gate.

Architect bindings (SPEC-303b / #396):
  B1  ``@org/team`` entries → unconditional HUMAN_REQUIRED, no membership expansion.
  B2  Bot accounts come from BOT_ACCOUNTS — the same variable require_human_approval.py
      reads. No split definition.
  B3  CODEOWNERS is re-read on every ``check_pr_files`` call. No cross-invocation cache.
  B4  Pattern matching reuses the glob_to_regex translation semantics from
      require_human_approval.py (conservative; errs toward HUMAN_REQUIRED).
  B5  stdlib only.

Design: ``docs/v0.4.0/TECHNICAL-DESIGN-303b-codeowners-bypass.md``.

The module is pure: no git, no gh, no network. The caller (overseer) supplies the
list of changed files derived from the PR diff and the bot-account set.
