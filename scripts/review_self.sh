# Sends all agent definitions, scripts, and the contract to agy and asks it to
# check for:
#   1. Internal consistency — do file paths, schema field names, and variable
#      names match across agents, scripts, and the contract?
#   2. Completeness — are there pipeline gaps where no agent or script handles
#      a required action?
#   3. Correctness — logical flaws, missing error handling, unreachable code,
#      shell quoting issues, broken Python
#   4. Contract compliance — do the agents correctly implement what
#      OVERSIGHT-CONTRACT.md specifies, and vice versa?
#   5. Design intent — anything that looks like it contradicts the stated goals
#      in CLAUDE.md or METHODOLOGY.md

PROMPT="You are an independent technical reviewer examining the Human Oversight System (HOS) — a framework for scaling human oversight of AI-generated code.

${SCOPE_INSTRUCTION}

## What you are reviewing

The HOS consists of:
- 6 oversight agents (.claude/agents/) that sit above a project's base development agents
- Scripts for running cross-vendor reviews (run_second_review.sh, run_red_team.sh)
- Validator scripts for risk scoring (run_validators.sh + validators/)
- An install script (install.sh)
- A portability contract (OVERSIGHT-CONTRACT.md) that any compliant agent team must implement

The system was designed with these goals (from METHODOLOGY.md and CLAUDE.md):
1. Portable: installable into any project via install.sh
2. Contract-based: oversight agents program against the contract, not against project-specific agent names
3. Risk-stratified: expensive external reviews only at higher risk scores
4. Independent: cross-vendor reviewers never see internal reviewer findings (decorrelation)
5. Audit-trail: sign-off register + token tracker + issue creation create a durable record

## Your review tasks

For each finding, state:
- Which files are involved
- What the specific problem is (quote the relevant lines/field names)
- Why it matters (what breaks or is inconsistent)
- A concrete fix

### 1. Internal consistency
Cross-reference field names, file paths, and data structures across files.

Specific things to check:
- The sign-off register format in OVERSIGHT-CONTRACT.md §3 vs. what oversight-evaluator.md reads
- The step manifest fields in OVERSIGHT-CONTRACT.md §5 vs. what oversight-evaluator.md checks
- File paths written by agents (e.g. \`.claudetmp/oversight/step{N}-evaluation-{ts}.md\`) vs. what oversight-orchestrator.md reads
- Variable names in run_second_review.sh (AGY_PROMPT, AGY_OUT, CODEX_OUT, etc.) vs. what token_tracker.py expects
- The risk tier thresholds in run_second_review.sh (\$AGY_THRESHOLD) vs. what schema.py defines as tier boundaries
- The sign-off entry that risk-assessor.md says it writes vs. what oversight-evaluator.md says it reads

### 2. Pipeline completeness
Using the pipeline diagram in CLAUDE.md as the source of truth:

- For each pipeline stage, is there an agent or script that handles it?
- Are there handoffs where the output of one component is never consumed by anything?
- Is the sign-off register written by all required agents for every step? Check each agent file.
- The contract says test agents write test declarations — do the base agents (unit-test, system-test) actually produce sign-off register entries? (Hint: they were amended to create GitHub issues but check if they write to the register.)
- Does oversight-orchestrator.md correctly reference the output of oversight-evaluator.md?
- Does run_second_review.sh correctly produce output that oversight-evaluator.md reads?

### 3. Correctness

Shell script issues:
- In run_second_review.sh: is the fallback logic (when agy unavailable, codex covers both lenses) correctly gated? Check the condition that prevents running codex twice.
- In run_red_team.sh: does the token tracker section reference variables (CODEX_OUT, AGY_OUT) that are defined in all code paths?
- In install.sh: does the rsync command for copying oversight scripts have the right source and destination paths?
- In run_validators.sh: does the inline Python script that produces summary.json handle empty validator results correctly?

Python issues:
- In rn_calculator.py: does \`_collect_functions\` correctly avoid double-counting nested functions? The inner \`_Collector\` calls \`ast.walk\` on the function node which would re-visit nested functions already visited at the top level.
- In token_tracker.py: the \`report\` function has a signature mismatch — it expects \`args.all\` but the subparser uses \`store_true\` for \`--all\`. Verify this works.

### 4. Contract compliance

- Does oversight-evaluator.md check all the compliance conditions listed in OVERSIGHT-CONTRACT.md §7?
- Does OVERSIGHT-CONTRACT.md §3 (sign-off schema) match what oversight-evaluator.md actually reads from the register?
- Are the \"issue creation rules\" in OVERSIGHT-CONTRACT.md §6 consistent with what the individual agent files (security-reviewer, privacy-reviewer, etc.) actually do?
- Does the step-manifest.template.yaml correctly demonstrate all the fields that OVERSIGHT-CONTRACT.md §5 defines?

### 5. Design intent
- Is there anything in the agents or scripts that contradicts the independence principle (cross-vendor reviewers should not see internal reviewer findings)?
- Does any agent or script create a single point of failure where the whole pipeline stops if one component is missing?
- Is the \"never lowers risk tier\" invariant correctly enforced in risk-assessor.md?

## Output format

Return a structured report with sections matching the 5 tasks above.

For each finding use:
**[SEVERITY]** — severity is one of: CRITICAL (breaks the pipeline), HIGH (significant flaw), MEDIUM (inconsistency or gap), LOW (minor issue or style)

**Finding:** [one sentence]
**Files:** [list of files involved]
**Evidence:** [specific lines or field names that demonstrate the problem]
**Fix:** [concrete change]

End with a brief overall assessment: is the system coherent and likely to work as designed?
